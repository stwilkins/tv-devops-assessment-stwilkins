# 🚀 DevOps Assessment – Full Lifecycle Challenge

**Estimated Time:** 4–8 hours
**Level:** Intermediate
**Focus Areas:** Dockerization · Infrastructure as Code · CI/CD · AWS

---

## 🧩 Overview

You will be working from a pre-built Express.js + TypeScript starter application. Your task is to:

1. Containerize the application and create a local dev environment
2. Define a production-ready cloud deployment using CDK for Terraform
3. Automate deployment via GitHub Actions

You **may deploy to your own AWS account for testing**, but your solution must be **fully portable and documented** so we can deploy it into **our AWS environment**.

---

## 🚀 Get Started

Fork or clone the starter repository:

🔗 https://github.com/TurboVets/tv-devops-assessment

This contains the basic Express app you’ll be building on.

---

## 📦 Deliverables

You must submit **one GitHub repository** with the following folder structure in the root:

### 1. `app/`

Contains the application code and:

- `Dockerfile`
- `docker-compose.yml`
- GitHub Actions workflows
- `README.md` with local setup and CI/CD instructions

### 2. `iac/`

Contains the infrastructure code and:

- CDK for Terraform (in TypeScript)
- Configuration templates
- `README.md` with deployment instructions for our AWS account

---

## 🧪 Requirements

### 🔧 Part 1: Docker Compose (Local Dev)

- Create a production-optimized `Dockerfile` (multi-stage build, minimal layers, small image)
- Create a `docker-compose.yml` to orchestrate the app
- Add a `.dockerignore` to reduce build context size
- App must respond to `http://localhost:3000/health`

---

### ☁️ Part 2: AWS Infrastructure with CDKTF

Use **CDK for Terraform (TypeScript)** to define:

- ECR repository
- ECS service (Fargate or EC2)
- VPC, subnets, security groups
- IAM roles (least privilege)
- (Optional) Load Balancer or API Gateway

#### AWS Guidelines

- You may deploy to your own AWS account for validation
- **DO NOT hardcode account IDs, regions, or credentials**
- All infrastructure must be configurable using:
  - `cdktf.json`
  - `.env` or config files
  - Environment variables

#### Documentation Required

- Include **clear instructions** on how to:
  - Override variables to use **our AWS account**
  - Deploy and destroy the stack
- The final deployment must produce a publicly accessible `/health` endpoint

---

### 🔁 Part 3: GitHub Actions CI/CD

Set up GitHub Actions to:

- Trigger on push to `main`
- Build and tag a Docker image
- Push to ECR
- Deploy via `cdktf deploy`

#### Workflow Requirements

- Use GitHub Secrets to store:
  - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
  - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
  - Any other required env vars
- Parameterize everything (ECR URI, region, etc.)
- Include instructions for configuring secrets
- Add a CI badge to the `README.md`

---

## 🎥 Required: 2–5 Minute Walkthrough Video

Record a screen-share video where you walk through:

- Your Docker and Compose setup
- CDKTF constructs and structure
- GitHub Actions workflows
- How we can configure and deploy it in our AWS account
- Any challenges or decisions worth noting

You do not need to appear on camera.

## ✅ Evaluation Criteria

| Area             | Expectation                                                              |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Docker Setup** | Clean, production-ready image; Compose works locally                     |
| **IaC Quality**  | CDKTF code is modular, portable, and secure                              |
| **CI/CD Flow**   | GitHub Actions runs cleanly; secrets handled properly                    |
| **Portability**  | Can be deployed in our AWS account without code changes                  |
| **Documentation**| Detailed, step-by-step usage and setup instructions                      |
| **Security**     | No hardcoded secrets or account info; uses IAM and GitHub Secrets        |
| **Communication**| Clear, concise walkthrough video explaining design and deployment        |

---

## 🧠 Bonus Points

- Add Route53 and HTTPS
- CloudWatch logs and alerts
- Support multiple environments (dev/staging/prod)
- Use remote Terraform backend (S3 + DynamoDB)

---

## 📥 Submission Instructions

Submit a single GitHub repository containing both `app/` and `iac/`.

Then share:

- ✅ GitHub repo link
- ✅ Video walkthrough link (Loom, Google Drive, YouTube, etc.)
- ✅ (Optional) Any extra notes or setup info we should know

---

## 🔐 Grant GitHub Access

Please add the following as **Admin Collaborators** to your GitHub repository:

- `ana@turbovets.com`
- `dean@turbovets.com`
- `charishma@turbovets.com`

### How to Add Admins

1. Open your repo on GitHub
2. Go to **Settings → Collaborators and teams**
3. Click **Invite a collaborator**
4. Enter the emails above
5. Set access level to **Admin**

This gives us access to CI history, secrets, and workflow configurations for review.
